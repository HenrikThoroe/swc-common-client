# Mobility

## Move Probability in Relation to Time
Drag and set moves should depend on the time the game is already runnunig. 
In the first half of the game set moves are more important to bring as many pieces as possible 
into the game to improve the mobility in the late game. Meanwhile drag moves are more efficent 
in the second half of the game.

Set Moves: Blue**

## Move Probability in Relation to Pieces on Field
The probabiloity of a move should depend on the importance of the gained mobility. 
A move which covers a field for the third+ time is not as important as a move which covers 
a field for the first or second time.

## Move Probability in Relation to Distance to Hive Center
The importance of a move which covers a field far away from the hive's center is not as important as 
a move which gives mobility near the own or the opponent's queen.
